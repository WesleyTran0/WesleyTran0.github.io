SearchNEU is a student-built course catalog for Northeastern University that displays
instructor information, meeting times, prerequisites, and section availability—all in a clean,
searchable interface with notifications for when sections open up.

As part of Sandbox, Northeastern's student-led software consultancy, I contributed to SearchNEU
during my first semester in the organization. I was focused on building the notifications page
from scratch, a long requested feature that would allow students to finally track, manage, and
view the sections and classes they were subscribed to all in one place. I also worked on backend
database adjustments and endpoints to support this new feature.

This project marked the beginning of my journey as a professional developer. At the time I
started working on Search, the project was over eight years old. This meant learning to
navigate existing architecture, understanding and questioning decisions made long before I joined, and
writing code that made sense within established patterns. It was also my first real experience
with the modern developer toolkit—Git workflows, Docker, pull requests, and collaborative
code review—practices that continue to drive how I work today.

Beyond picking up technical skills, SearchNEU taught me what it means to contribute to
something larger than a solo project. Learning to write code that others would read, review,
and build upon changed how I think about clarity, documentation, and maintainability.
