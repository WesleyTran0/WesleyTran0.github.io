Good Dog Licensing is a free, student-run music synchronization service at Northeastern University
that connects independent musicians with media makers seeking music for their projects.

As part of [Sandbox](https://www.sandboxnu.com/), Northeastern's student-led software consultancy, I contributed to [Good Dog's
website redesign](https://good-dog-licensing.vercel.app/), working across the stack on the login flow, profile page, site-wide navigation, and music submission process.
On the frontend, I worked with our designers to translate their wireframes into clean, polished interfaces
that matched the platform's new visual direction. On the backend, I built tRPC endpoints to fetch pre-fill
values from users' previous submissions, streamlining the music submission process for returning artists and media makers.

This project reinforced my ability to work on full-stack applications in a team environment—coordinating with
designers on implementation details, writing backend logic that other developers could easily extend,
and delivering features that tied both halves together into a cohesive user experience.

Beyond the technical work, contributing to Good Dog gave me insight into the music licensing industry
and the legal frameworks that make synchronization possible. Working alongside [Professor Herlihy](https://camd.northeastern.edu/people/david-herlihy/)'s Music
Licensing for Media course and Green Line Records meant understanding not just how to build features,
but why they mattered to real users navigating copyright, attribution, and creative collaboration.
