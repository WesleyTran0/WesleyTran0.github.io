# My First Ever Homelab

This is not only my first ever full documentation through a project I completed, my first ever
attempt at creating a homelab, and my first ever long-term project that I actually see myself
accessing and using every single day, BUT it's also my first blog. SO let's get into it.

## My Goals

I want to preface not only this blog but also this entire project by saying, I am not looking for
many to read through this (in fact I'd imagine no one will ever look through this), but I am still
excited to finally be writing a blog. I think it will not only be easier for me as I work through my
projects to document the steps I took, but also to be able to look back and visualize my thinking process
and see how it evolves.

Having said that, going into this homelab, I had a couple goals. I've been meaning to do some sort of
cyber project for a while, and due to university and a... interesting infrastructure at Northeastern University
that I did not feel ready to tackle, I hadn't gotten around to it. With the start of winter break, and access
to some old laptops, I knew I wanted to self-host a couple things on my own. Not really knowing what I was getting into,
I knew I wanted to at the very least, learn about:

- How do domains work, and seriously, how do I get one of my own.
- What is a tunnel, what is Tailscale, how can I possibly open a self-hosted device without having my home internet hacked
- Make some sort of environment (going into the project, I am hoping proxmox) secure and available from anywhere
- Fix the storage problem on my family and I's devices (phones)
- Be ready to build upon what I have and run experiments on new VMs, without having to worry about clutter on my laptop
